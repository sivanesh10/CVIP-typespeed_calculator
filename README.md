# CVIP-typespeed_calculator


This code is a simple Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a basic word typing game. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Import necessary modules:

Tkinter for creating the GUI.
default_timer from the timeit module for timing the player's typing speed.
Create the main GUI window:

The main GUI window is created using Tk() and set to a size of 450x200 pixels.
Define global variables:

x is used to keep track of the game state.
gui is a reference to the main GUI window.
Define the game() function:

This function serves as the main game loop.
If x is 0 (initial state), it destroys the previous GUI window.
Inside the function, a new game is started.
The player is presented with a random word ("codercave") to type, and the timer (start) begins.
Define the result() function:

This function is called when the player is done typing and clicks the "Done" button.
It compares the player's input (retrieved from the Entry widget) to the expected word.
If the input matches, it stops the timer (end) and calculates the time taken to complete the word. It then displays the time on the GUI.
If the input is incorrect, it prints "Wrong Input."
Create a new GUI for the game inside the game() function:

A new GUI window is created with the same dimensions.
The word to type is displayed at the top, and instructions are given.
An Entry widget is provided for the player to type the word.
"Done" and "Try Again" buttons are included. "Done" calls the result() function, and "Try Again" restarts the game.
Create a label and a "Go" button in the main GUI window:

The main window displays a label "Lets Play The Game!" and a "Go" button.
Clicking the "Go" button starts the game by calling the game() function.
Start the main GUI event loop with gui.mainloop().

When you run this code, it will create a simple game where the player is asked to type the word "codercave" as fast as possible, and their typing speed is recorded. The player can click "Done" to stop the timer and see their result or click "Try Again" to start a new game.
